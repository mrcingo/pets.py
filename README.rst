------------------

- Create CMake builds.
- Integrate `pybind11`.
- Packages.

Installing

**Python 3.9 or higher is required**

.. note::

    A `Virtual Environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ is recommended to install
    the library, especially on Linux where the system Python is externally managed and restricts which
    packages you can install on it.

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/mrcingo/pets.py
    $ cd pets.py
    $ python3 -m pip install -U .
